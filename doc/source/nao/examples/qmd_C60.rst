nao.examples.qmd_C60 --- NAO Examples: QMD C60
**********************************************
A demonstration of the Nao module used to calculates the polarizability
of C60 at rooms temperature using Quantum Molecular Dynamic (QMD).
The relaxation and the ground states calculations are done using the Siesta
program. This example will calculate the geometries of 5000 step of C60 using Siesta
and the polarizability will be obtained by calculating 200 steps. This example MUST be
done on a server because it will perform 200 calculations. This example has been done
for the `Torque <https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/TORQUE>`_ ressources manager and will 
need to be adapted to your case before to run.
